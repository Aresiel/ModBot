<h1>Methods</h1>
<h2>CallPrivateMethod (Non-static)<a href="#non-static-footnote"><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>

	CallPrivateMethod (Non-static) takes 1-2 arguments (2nd is null by default):<br>
	The first argument is a string, this is the name if the private or protected method you want to call, note that it is case-sensitive.<br>
